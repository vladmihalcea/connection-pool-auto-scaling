# Installs the Temurin 25 JDK of the ICASC runs (25.0.3+9 by default, TEMURIN_VERSION to change it) into
# /opt/temurin-25, after checking the SHA-256 that Adoptium publishes next to the tarball. It is the same as the
# reservoir bundle's setup-jdk25.sh, so running either is enough. Run as root, once per server and outside any
# measurement window. It does not change the default java of the system, so the Temurin 21 of the TOSEM bundles
# stays as it is; run.sh finds /opt/temurin-25 on its own. Running it again is harmless.
